/*
Package queue provides an in-memory queue structure suitable for the safe and
low latency implementation of a real job queue.

It's like beanstalkd, but faster, with the ability to query the queue for
desired items, reject duplicates, and wait on dependencies.

Like beanstalkd, when you add items to the queue, they move between different
sub-queues:

Items start in the ready queue. From there you can Reserve() an item to get the
highest priority (or for those with equal priority, the largest, and for those
with equal size, the oldest - fifo) one which switches it from the ready queue
to the run queue.

Items can also have dependencies, in which case they start in the dependency
queue and only move to the ready queue once all its dependencies have been
Remove()d from the queue. Items can also belong to a reservation group, in which
case you can Reserve() an item in a desired group.

In the run queue the item starts a time-to-release (ttr) countdown; when that
runs out the item is placed (by default) in the delay queue. After the delay
period it will automatically switch to the ready queue. This is to handle a
process Reserving an item but then crashing before it deals with the item; with
it back on the ready queue, some other process can pick it up.

To stop it going to the delay queue you either Remove() the item (you dealt
with the item successfully), Touch() it to give yourself more time to handle the
item, or you Bury() the item (the item can't be dealt with until the user takes
some action). When you know you have a transient problem preventing you from
handling the item right now, you can manually Release() the item to the delay
queue.
